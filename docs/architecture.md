## The deployment map

![Deployment map: your devices reach CloudFront in your AWS account, which routes API paths to API Gateway and the Go Lambda, and everything else to Next.js on Lambda with S3 assets and an SQS and DynamoDB revalidation cache. EventBridge runs a daily jobs Lambda. GitHub Actions deploys through an OIDC role and runs a migrate Lambda. The Go functions use Neon Postgres, and sign-in goes through Google. Each part is labeled with its monthly cost, about ten cents in total.](brand/architecture.png)

Everything in the AWS box is serverless: nothing runs, and nothing is billed, while nobody uses the
app. [`sst.config.ts`](../sst.config.ts) defines all of it.

## What it costs

Estimated for **`sa-east-1` (São Paulo)**, the default and one of AWS's pricier regions, with
**October 2026 prices**. The assumed usage is a two-person household: about 30,000 API requests and
10,000 page loads a month, a 50 MB database and a daily job.

| Service                                 | What it does                          | Free tier                                     | Monthly cost                         |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| CloudFront                              | Router and CDN in front of everything | 1 TB and 10M requests, **always free**        | $0, plus ≈ $0.04 per deploy          |
| Lambda (Go API, Next.js, jobs, migrate) | Runs all the code                     | 1M requests and 400,000 GB-s, **always free** | $0 (≈ $0.06 without the free tier)   |
| API Gateway (HTTP API)                  | Front door to the Go API              | 1M requests, **first 12 months**              | $0, then ≈ $0.06 ($1.59 per million) |
| S3                                      | Static assets for the web app         | 5 GB, first 12 months                         | < $0.01                              |
| SQS + DynamoDB                          | Next.js revalidation cache            | 1M requests and 25 GB, **always free**        | $0                                   |
| EventBridge                             | Daily schedule for the jobs           | Scheduled rules are free                      | $0                                   |
| CloudWatch Logs                         | Function logs                         | 5 GB, **always free**                         | $0                                   |
| Neon Postgres                           | The database                          | Free plan: 100 CU-hours, 0.5 GB per project   | $0                                   |
| GitHub Actions                          | Deploys                               | Free for public repositories                  | $0                                   |
| **Total**                               |                                       |                                               | **≈ $0.10 after the first year**     |

At **ten times that usage** the total stays under $1 a month: API Gateway is the only line that grows
past its free tier. Above Neon's free plan, its Launch plan bills by use (about $0.11 per CU-hour and
$0.35 per GB-month).

Each deploy also costs about **$0.04**. The router keeps its routes in a CloudFront KeyValueStore and
rewrites them on every deploy, and KeyValueStore API calls aren't in the free tier. A month with no
deploys costs nothing extra: a measured week of daily use, statement imports included, came to $0
outside the deploy days.

## How a request flows

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  B["Browser / phone"] --> CF["CloudFront router"]
  AI["Claude (MCP)"] --> CF
  CF -- "/api · /auth · /mcp · /oauth · /.well-known/oauth-*" --> GW["API Gateway"]
  CF -- "everything else" --> WEB["Next.js on Lambda"]
  WEB -- "server components (API_INTERNAL_URL)" --> GW
  GW --> API["Go API (Lambda)"]
  API --> DB[("Neon Postgres")]
  API --> G["Google sign-in"]
```

- The browser only ever talks to one origin, so the session cookie stays first-party.
- Server-rendered pages call API Gateway directly instead of going back through CloudFront.
- The API speaks [Connect-RPC](https://connectrpc.com): plain HTTP POST with JSON or protobuf, unary
  calls only, because API Gateway buffers responses.

## One handler, two homes

The Go API is one `http.Handler`, built in `backend/internal/server`:

| Where        | Entrypoint           | How it's served                                |
| ------------ | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Your machine | `backend/cmd/api`    | A plain `net/http` server on `127.0.0.1:8080`  |
| AWS          | `backend/cmd/lambda` | Wrapped by an API Gateway v2 adapter on Lambda |

Locally, Next.js proxies `/api`, `/auth`, `/mcp` and `/oauth` to the API, which is the same routing
CloudFront does in AWS. Nothing in the local setup depends on AWS.

## Scheduled work and migrations

- **Jobs** (`backend/cmd/jobs`) run daily from EventBridge. They top up recurring transactions three
  months ahead and purge expired imports. They're idempotent, so a missed day is harmless. Locally,
  `task jobs` runs them once.
- **Migrations** (`backend/cmd/migrate`, [goose](https://github.com/pressly/goose)) run on every
  deploy, from a Lambda, against Neon's direct host. They roll out next to the new API code, so they
  stay backward-compatible.

## The stack

| Layer   | Tech                                                                                      |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| API     | Go, [Connect-RPC](https://connectrpc.com) (protobuf via `buf`), `net/http`                |
| Data    | PostgreSQL, `sqlc` + `pgx/v5`, `goose` migrations                                         |
| Web     | Next.js (App Router, SSR), Tailwind v4, shadcn/ui themed with the Module/01 design system |
| Tooling | Bun workspaces, Taskfile, Biome, testcontainers-go, Playwright                            |
| Hosting | AWS Lambda + API Gateway (Go), OpenNext (Next.js), via SST; Postgres on Neon              |

## Design rules

These hold everywhere in the code, and they're why the numbers add up:

- **Money is integer minor units** plus an ISO 4217 code, never floats. Transfer rates are decimal
  strings in the API and `numeric` in Postgres.
- **Every row belongs to a household**, and every query filters by the household from the session,
  never from the request.
- **Today comes from the client.** Rows dated after it are upcoming: they never count in balances,
  reports or budgets.
- **The API is Lambda-safe:** stateless, with sessions in Postgres, configuration only from
  environment variables, and no background goroutines.
