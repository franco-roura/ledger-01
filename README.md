## Everything a household ledger needs

Wallets in any currency, with categories, labels and notes on every transaction. Transfers between
currencies, where you type any two of sent, received and rate. Dashboards, budgets, and recurring
bills that show up in a Future view without touching today's balance.

**[Read more: the features tour →](docs/features.md)**

## Up and running in five minutes

Four commands start Postgres, the API and the web app on your machine, and a dev-only login skips
the Google setup. The guide then walks you through your first wallet, transaction, import and
budget.

**[Read more: getting started →](docs/getting-started.md)**

## Your bank statements, without the typing

Import CSV, XLSX and XLS statements with column mapping and duplicate detection. Discounts and refunds
are matched to the purchases they belong to. Backups restore on any instance, and CSV export opens
straight in a spreadsheet.

**[Read more: import, backup and export →](docs/your-data.md)**

## Ask your AI about your money

Ledger/01 is an MCP server. Add it to Claude as a connector, sign in, and ask questions about your own
numbers. Access is read-only, and you can disconnect it from Settings at any time.

**[Read more: AI assistants →](docs/ai-assistants.md)**

## Host it yourself on AWS

One GitHub Actions workflow deploys the whole app to your own AWS account with SST. There are no
long-lived keys: the workflow signs in to AWS with GitHub's OIDC, and your secrets stay in your
repository's `production` environment.

**[Read more: self-hosting →](docs/self-hosting.md)**

## Serverless, so it costs cents

The Go API and the Next.js app run on Lambda behind CloudFront, and Postgres runs on Neon, which
scales to zero. With nothing running, nothing is billed. A typical household's month comes to about
ten cents.

</p>

**[Read more: architecture and costs →](docs/architecture.md)**

## Open source, open contract

A Go API on Connect-RPC, a Next.js web app, and one protobuf contract that generates both clients.
Run `task test:unit` for unit tests without Docker, `task test:integration` for the full Go suite
against real PostgreSQL, and `task e2e` for desktop/mobile browser tests. `task test:coverage`
generates coverage reports. See [Testing](docs/testing.md) for setup, scope and CI artifacts.
Every release follows semantic versioning.

## Contributing

Bug reports, fixes and new banks are all welcome. Adding your bank is one small Go file and a test.
